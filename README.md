# # Virtual Mouse Using OpenCV üñ±Ô∏èü§è
## Project Descriptionüìù
This project implements a virtual mouse using OpenCV and computer vision techniques. The virtual mouse enables users to control the cursor on their PC or laptop based on finger movements captured by a camera. This innovative approach provides a hands-free method of interacting with the computer, enhancing accessibility and providing an alternative input method.

## Features ü™Ñ

 -   **Real-Time Cursor Control:** Uses computer vision to track finger movements and control the cursor in real-time.
-   **Gesture Recognition:** Supports various gestures for mouse actions such as click, double-click, and drag.
-   **Customizable Sensitivity:** Allows adjustment of cursor sensitivity and speed.
-   **Cross-Platform:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
## Prerequisites üåü

-   Python 3.7 or higher
-   OpenCV
-   Mediapipe
-   Numpy
-   PyAutoGUI

## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    `git clone https://github.com/shithaarthan/virtual-mouse.git` 

## Usage

1.  **Run the virtual mouse script:**
    
    `python virtual_mouse.py` 
    
2.  **Configuration:**
    
    -  -   Adjust the sensitivity and other parameters in the `virtual_mouse.py ` file to suit your needs.
3.  **Integrating with Multiple Cameras:**
    
    -   Modify the `camera_sources` list in `virtual_mouse.py ` to include URLs or device indices of the cameras.
  1.  **Usage Instructions:**
    
      **Moving the Cursor:** Move your index finger to control the cursor.
      **Left Click:** Touch your thumb and index finger together.
    **Right Click:** Touch your thumb and middle finger together.
     **Double Click:** Touch your thumb and index finger together twice.
  **Drag and Drop:** Touch your thumb and index finger together and move them while holding.
